      "Okay, let's see. The user is in a battle where their active Pokemon is Scrafty, which is a DARK type, and it has a base stats of 90 ATK, 115 DEF, etc. The opponent's active Pokemon is UXIE, also a DARK type, with similar stats. Now, the current battle state mentions their HP is 100% and the opponent's HP is 100% as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to decide whether to switch to another Pokémon or use a move. Let's check the available options. There are available switches: rampardos, slowbrogalar, eternatus, yanmega, and clefable. Both Scrafty and UXIE are DARK types, so switching to a Pokémon with a DARK type would be good. However, looking at the switches, none of them have a DARK type. Wait, the user's current Pokémon is already DARK, so switching to another DARK type would be a good move. But the available switches don't include a DARK type. Wait, the switches listed are all HP 100% and Status None. So maybe there's no switch available for a DARK type? Wait, the user's current Pokémon is already DARK, so perhaps switching to another Pokémon with a DARK type is possible. But the available switches don't include that. Hmm, maybe there's no switch available, so the user has to switch their own Pokémon. Or maybe there's a switch for another type. Wait, the available switches are all HP 100% and Status None. So if the user can switch to another Pokémon with the same type, but there are no such switches listed, then the user has to use their current Pokémon, which is already DARK, but they might need to switch. Wait, but the opponent's type is also DARK. Maybe the user can switch to a Pokémon with a different type. But the available switches don't include that. Wait, the available switches are all for HP 100% and Status None. So maybe the user is already in the correct move. Alternatively, perhaps the user should use a move. Let's look at the moves. The available moves include poisonjab, knockoff, dragondance, closecombat. Both Scrafty and UXIE are DARK, so maybe using a move that deals damage to the opponent's Pokémon. But the opponent's Pokémon is UXIE, which is also DARK. So using a move that deals damage to UXIE. Let's see: poisonjab would target UXIE. Alternatively, knockoff. Let's check the stats. Scrafty has a higher ATK than UXIE, so maybe using poisonjab would be better. But the opponent's Pokémon is already at maximum HP, so maybe a move that deals a lot of damage. Alternatively, using a move that reduces the opponent's HP. Let's think: if the opponent is at maximum, using a move that deals maximum damage would be better. So poisonjab, which has a BP of 80, which is high, and Acc is 1.0. That would be a good move. Alternatively, dragondance, which is a dragon type, but the opponent's type is DARK. So maybe not. Closecombat, which is a physical move, but the opponent's type is DARK. So maybe poisonjab is better. So the best action would be to use poisonjab. But wait, the user's current Pokémon is Scrafty. Maybe they should switch to another Pokémon. Wait, but the opponent's type is also DARK. Maybe the user should switch to a Pokémon with a DARK type. But the available switches don't include that. Wait, the available switches are all HP 100% and Status None. So perhaps the user has to switch to their current Pokémon, but that's already DARK. Alternatively, maybe the user should switch to another Pokémon. But there are no switches available for other types. Wait, maybe the user can switch to their own Pokémon. But the available switches are all for HP 100% and Status None. So perhaps the user is already in the correct move. But wait, the opponent's type is also DARK, so maybe the user should switch to a Pokémon with a DARK type. But there are no such switches. Therefore, the user has to either switch their own Pokémon or use a move. Since there are no switches available, the user has to switch their own Pokémon. But the available switches don't include a DARK type, so maybe the user can switch to another Pokémon. Wait, but the available switches are all for HP 100% and Status None. So perhaps there's no switch available. Therefore, the user has to use their current Pokémon, which is already DARK. But the battle state shows that both Pokémon are at maximum HP, so using a move that deals damage would be appropriate. So poisonjab is the move to use. Therefore, the best action is to use poisonjab.\n",

Let's check the moves. The closest is closecombat, which deals 120 BP and is physical. If Scrafty uses that, maybe they can deal damage. Or maybe use poisonjab, but that's a different type. Alternatively, maybe switch to a Pokémon with a better type. Wait, the available switches are rampardos, slowbrogalar, eternatus, yanmega, clefable. All HP 100% and status. If they switch to a Pokémon with a higher attack or defense, maybe that's better. But the user is already fighting Dark-type, so switching to another Dark-type might not help. Wait, but the opponent is also Dark. So maybe the best is to use a move that attacks in the same type. Closecombat is a good choice. Or maybe poisonjab. Let me check the stats. Scrafty has 90 atk, which is lower than the opponent's 50. So using poisonjab might be better. But wait, the opponent's current status is PSN, so maybe using a move that deals damage is better. Alternatively, maybe switch to a Pokémon. Wait, the user's side conditions are empty, and the opponent's is also empty. If they switch to a different type, but the available switches are all status. Wait, the user's goal is to win, so maybe they should use a move that can take advantage of the types. Alternatively, if they switch to a different Pokémon. Wait, the user's Scrafty is already active. So maybe the best action is to use a move that attacks, like closecombat, or maybe poisonjab. Let me think again. The opponent's move is closecombat, which is a physical move. If Scrafty can use that, that's a good move. Or perhaps use poisonjab. Wait, the available moves are poisonjab (type POISON, which is a different type than Scrafty's DARK). So that's a different type. So maybe using poisonjab would be a good move. But the opponent is also Dark. Wait, so if they use poisonjab, it's a different type. But maybe the best is to use a move that deals damage. Let's compare the moves. Closecombat deals 120 BP, which is a good move. So maybe use closecombat. Alternatively, poisonjab. Which is better? Well, the user's Scrafty has a base stat of 90 atk, which is lower than the opponent's 50. So using poisonjab would be better. So maybe poisonjab. But wait, the opponent's move is closecombat. So maybe the best action is to use a move that attacks, like closecombat. But how do I decide? Let me check the functions again. The user can choose move or switch. Since the user's active is Scrafty, maybe they should use a move. Let me check the available moves again. The moves are poisonjab, knockoff, dragondance, closecombat. Closecombat is a good move. So the best action would be to use closecombat. Alternatively, maybe switch to a different Pokémon. But the user's side is already active, so they can't switch. Wait, the opponent's side is also active. So maybe the best is to use a move. So the answer would be to use closecombat. Let me confirm. Yes, closecombat is a physical move, which is good against Dark-type Pokémon. So the tool call would be choose_move with closecombat.\n",

Alternatively, maybe switch to a Pokémon that can counterattack. Since Scrafty is DARK, maybe using a move that deals damage to the opponent's Pokémon. Let me check the available moves again.

The user has options like rampardos, slowbrogalar, eternatus, yanmega, clefable. All of these are HP 100% and status None. So switching to any of those would be a good idea because they don't have HP and are immune to status. Alternatively, maybe use a move that deals damage. Let me think: if the opponent is using a status move, maybe using a move that deals damage. For example, poisonjab would be good. But since the opponent is already in a state, maybe using a move that negates their status. Let me check the functions again. The user has the ability to choose between move or switch.

Alternatively, since the opponent is using a status move, maybe switch to a Pokémon that can counterattack. The available switches are all HP 100% and status None. So switching to any of them would be a good idea. Let's say we switch to a Pokémon with HP 100% and status None. That way, they don't have HP, so their move can be used against Scrafty.

So if we switch to a Pokémon that can use a status move, that would negate their attack. Let me check: the available moves are poisonjab, knockoff, dragondance, closecombat.

But all available switches are status None. So maybe switch to any of those. Let me check the tools again. The user can choose between move or switch. So the best action would be to switch to a Pokémon with HP 100% and status None. That way, their move can be used against the opponent. Alternatively, maybe use a move. Let me think: if the opponent is using a status move, using a move that deals damage would be better. So maybe use poisonjab. But the opponent's move is closecombat, which is a status. So if we switch to a Pokémon with a status move, which is available. Let me check the available switches again. All have status None. So switching to any of them. Therefore, the best action is to switch to a Pokémon with status None. So the function call would be to choose_switch with the available switches. Alternatively, use a move. Let me check the functions again. The user can choose either move or switch. So the best action would be to switch to a Pokémon with status. Therefore, the tool call would be choose_switch with any of the available switches. So the correct function is choose_switch with a switch name like 'rampardos' (HP 100%).\n",

But the user's question is to choose between move or switch. So the answer would be to use poisonjab. Therefore, the tool call is choose_move with poisonjab.\n",

But wait, the opponent's type is Fire, and Scrafty is Dark. If they switch to a Fire-type, they could counterattack. However, the available switches don't have Fire-type, but there's a slowbrogalar, which is HP and status. But that's a switch. Maybe switching to a Pokémon with Fire-type would be better. Wait, but the available switches are all HP 100%, so maybe the opponent can switch too. But the user is in their own side. Wait, the opponent is active, so maybe they can switch. But the user's side conditions are empty, so maybe they can switch. Alternatively, the user can use a move. Let's think about the moves. Scrafty is a Fighting-type, so maybe a move that deals damage to the opponent's type. The opponent has Fire, so maybe a move that deals Fire-type damage. Let me check the available moves. The moves are poisonjab (poison), knockoff (dark), dragondance (dragon), and closecombat (physical). Closecombat is a physical move, but the opponent has Fire. So maybe using a closecombat would be better. But the opponent's base stats have Fire, so maybe using a move that targets Fire. Poisonjab is poison, knockoff is dark, dragondance is dragon, closecombat is physical. Closecombat is a physical move, so it deals physical damage. If the opponent is Fire, then closecombat would be a good move. But wait, the opponent's type is Fire, and Scrafty is Dark. So using a move that deals Fire-type damage would be appropriate. Let me check the move list again. Closecombat is a physical move, so if the opponent is Fire, that's a good move. Alternatively, if there's a move that deals Fire damage. But the available moves don't have a specific Fire-type move. So maybe closecombat is the best. Alternatively, using poisonjab (poison) would be a move to use against the opponent's Fire. But poisonjab deals poison, which is a different type. So maybe closecombat is better. Let me think again. The opponent is a Fire-type, and Scrafty is a Dark-type. So using a move that deals Fire-type damage would be good. Closecombat is a physical move, so it deals physical damage. If the opponent has Fire, then closecombat is a good move. Alternatively, maybe using poisonjab would be better. But poisonjab is a move that deals poison, which is a different type. So perhaps closecombat is better. Therefore, the best action would be to switch to a Pokémon with Fire-type, but the available switches don't have Fire. Wait, the available switches are all HP 100%, but the user is in their own side.

      "Okay, let's see. The user is in a battle where their active Pokemon is Slowbrogalar, which has a type of POISON and is a PSYCHIC-type. They have 83.1% HP, base stats like 100 atk, 95 def, etc., and a status of none. The opponent's active Pokemon is UXIE, also a PSYCHIC-type with 56% HP and similar stats.\n",

      "First, I need to decide whether to use a move or switch to a new Pokémon. Let's think about the current state. The user's Slowbrogalar is already active, so maybe they want to continue using it. But wait, the opponent is also using a PSYCHIC-type. If both have the same type, maybe there's a chance to counter with a move that deals with both types. But the user's move options include Psychic and others. Let me check the moves again. The available moves are shellsidearm, foulplay, surf, and psychic. The opponent's move is also Psychic. So if the user uses a Psychic move, maybe that's a good fit. But the user's base stats have 100 atk and 95 def, which are similar to UXIE's 75 atk and 130 def. So maybe using a move that deals with both types would be a good counter. But the user's current move is not a Psychic move. Wait, no, the user's own moves are all Psychic types. So maybe using a move that attacks or deals with their opponent's weakness. Alternatively, if they switch to a new Pokémon, but there are no switches listed except for eternatus, scrafty, yanmega, clefable. The opponent is already using a Psychic-type, so switching to a different type might not be necessary here. Let me think again. The user's current active Pokemon is already in the battle, and the opponent is also in the same. If they want to continue, maybe use a move that attacks. Let's look at the moves. The user can choose between shellsidearm (attack), foulplay (physical), surf (attack), or psychic (special). Since both are Psychic, using a move that attacks would be good. Let's say the user uses foulplay. But wait, the opponent is using a Psychic move too. So maybe they want to counter with a move that deals with their type. Alternatively, the user could switch to a new Pokémon, but there are no switches listed except for the four options. The opponent is already active, so maybe the user should switch to a new one. But the user's own stats are similar to the opponent's. Let me check the base stats. The user's atk is 100, def 95, which is similar to UXIE's 75 and 130. So if the user uses a move that deals with both, maybe a Psychic move. But the user's own move options include psychic. So the best action would be to use a psychic move, either shellsidearm or psychic. Alternatively, maybe switch to a new Pokémon. But the user's current active is already in the battle. So perhaps the best action is to use a move that attacks, like foulplay or surf. Let me check the base stats again. The user's atk is 100, which is higher than UXIE's 75. So using a move that deals with that would be effective. Let's say the user uses foulplay. But wait, the opponent is already using a Psychic move, so maybe the user's move is a counter. Alternatively, maybe the user can switch to a new Pokémon. But there are no switches listed except for the four options. Let me think. The user's own moves include Psychic, so using that would be the best. So the best action is to use a psychic move. Therefore, the tool call would be to choose_move with the psychic move.\n",

Poisonjab is a POISON type, which could be a good move. But Scrafty's base stats are atk 90, def 115, hp 65, etc. Opponent's base stats are atk 100, def 50, hp 80, etc. So maybe use a move that deals damage. Alternatively, switch to a Pokémon that can counter. But the user's current active is Scrafty. Let me think. The opponent's stats are higher, so maybe using a move that can deal with them.

But the user's current Pokémon is Bug, which is already in the field. So maybe using a move like uturn. Let me check the move options again. The available moves are airslash, uturn, gigadrain, and bugbuzz. If the opponent is using Psychic, and the user's Pokémon is Bug, then using a move that deals with Psychic is better. So using uturn. Alternatively, using a switch to a Bug. But the user's current Pokémon is Bug, so switching to a Bug. So maybe switch to a Bug. But the available switches don't have a Bug unless the user chooses to switch. Wait, the user's available switches include eternatus (HP: 100%), slowbrogalar (HP: 100%), and clefable (none). So if the user wants to switch, they can choose one. But the current state is that the user's active is Yanmega, which is Bug. So if they switch to a Bug, they can use their own moves. But the available moves include uturn and bugbuzz. So maybe using uturn. Alternatively, using a switch to a Clefable (none status), but that's not helpful. So the best action is to switch to a Bug. But the available switches don't have a Bug unless the user selects one. Wait, the user's available switches are eternatus (HP 100%), slowbrogalar (HP 100%), and clefable (none). So if they switch to a Bug, but none of the switches are Bug. So perhaps the user should switch to a Pokémon that can handle Psychic, but there's no such switch. Therefore, the best action is to switch to a Pokémon that can handle the opponent's Psychic. But there's no such switch. Therefore, the user should use a move. So the best action is to choose a move, perhaps uturn, to counter the opponent's Psychic. Alternatively, using a switch to a Pokémon that has the necessary status. But there's no such switch. So the answer would be to choose a move, perhaps uturn. Let me confirm. The user's current active is Yanmega (Bug), opponent's active is Uxie (Psychic). If they switch to a Bug, they can use uturn or bugbuzz. But the available moves don't include a switch to a Bug, so maybe they should switch to a Bug. But the available switches don't have a Bug. Wait, the user's available switches are eternatus, slowbrogalar, and clefable. So they can switch to any of those. Since the opponent is Psychic, maybe switch to a Pokémon that can handle that. But none of the switches are Psychic. Therefore, the user should use a move. So the best action is to use a move, like uturn or bugbuzz. Let me check the move options again. The available moves are airslash, uturn, gigadrain, and bugbuzz. So if the opponent is Psychic, and the user's Pokémon is Bug, then using a move that deals with Psychic is better. So uturn. Therefore, the best action is to use uturn.\n",
